# AntiVehicle
Welcome to AntiVehicle the plugin made for PvE servers wanting to catch those who pop off your darn tires. The log will go inside your console with the name and CSteamID of the idiot who tried to mess with your server along with that it will say whos vehicle was targeted.

Currently I am still working on the plugin so there will be errors once in a while. I am trying to fix a bug in which the console gives an error when a player hits a tire of a vehicle that is not locked.
